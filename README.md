# Uncertainty Dashboard

Our visualization proposes a reusable representation of prediction systems to guide decision makers to understand the implicit *uncertainty* that is present on *machine-learning* prediction systems.

In particular, for our case of study (*Academic Risk based on Historical Data)*. There are three main sources of *uncertainty*, the
**prediction model**, the **data consistency** and the **case completeness** of the historic dataset. **Uncertainty Dashboard** is a proposed visualization technique where the risk to fail in an academic semester is predicted by the machine learning algorithm and is  presented to the users (Professors and academics). So they can make an informed decision about the optimal student's academic load.
